To run tests:
    python -m pytest tests
you will need to install pytest
if you want to make new tests, you NEED to have an __init__.py in every directory
used for an import or it will complain along the lines of "Can't import Module 'xxx'"

for example, from src.GUI.mainWindow import MainWindow
needs a __init__.py file in the src/ and src/GUI directories
