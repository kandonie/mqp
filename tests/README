To run tests, from the mqp directory:
    python -m pytest tests

For test coverage:
in Windows
    python -m pytest --cov=<PathToMQP>\mqp tests --cov-report html --cov-report term-missing
ex)
 I apologize for my Windows path
 python -m pytest --cov=C:\Users\lhatf\Documents\GitHub\mqp tests --cov-report html --cov-report term-missing

for Linux just use Linux path with / instead of \

this will create a htmlcov directory which shows coverage results. Look at index.htm first then other .html
files for specific lines hit/missed on each file

you will want to do a pip install pytest-cov
if you want to make new tests, you NEED to have an __init__.py in every directory
used for an import or it will complain along the lines of "Can't import Module 'xxx'"

for example, from src.GUI.mainWindow import MainWindow
needs a __init__.py file in the src/ and src/GUI directories
