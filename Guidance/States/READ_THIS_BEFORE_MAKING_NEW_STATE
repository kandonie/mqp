Each new state must have the following:
    __init__(...)
        can have whatever params
    execute(self, robotData, stateArgs)
        it will be called in a loop
        MAKE EXECUTE AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE, IT CAN'T BE ITERRUPTED
        returns a bool which is True if the state is done executing, False otherwise
    getNextState()
        returns a tuple of (state, stateArgs) or None (None defaults to Estop next state)
    getType()
        returns the behavioral state

look at example_state for an example.

After adding the new state
    1. add it to one of the BehavioralStates in GuidanceEnums.py
    2. in stateMachine.py, add a statement to makeState to create the new state for the given Enum
