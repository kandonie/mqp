Each new state must have an __init__ and execute(self, robotData, stateArgs) function.
Execute must return a bool which is True if the state is done executing, false otherwise
It must also have a getNextState() function which returns a tuple of (state, stateArgs) or None (None defaults to Estop next state)
It must also have a getType, which returns the behavioral state
look at doc comments on IDLE state for more info
MAKE EXECUTE LOOP AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE, IT CAN'T BE ITERRUPTED
After adding the new state, add it to one of the BehavioralStates in GuidanceEnums.py
Then in stateMachine.py, add a statement to makeState to create the new state for the given Enum

This would normally be done through overriding methods but python doesn't care about
Types so we have to write this in this file
